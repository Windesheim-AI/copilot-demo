# Github Copilot Demo Repository
This repository is used to demonstrate the capabilities of Github Copilot.

## How to use this repository
This is a react application. To run it, you need to have node.js installed. Then, you can run the following commands:
```bash
npm install
npm start
```

## Tasks
Here are some tasks that you can try to complete using Github Copilot:
- [ ] Add a button to `App.tsx` by **adding a comment** inline.
- [ ] Add a button that changes the color of the text by using `CTRL+I` to **suggest code**.
- [ ] Add a button that changes the color of the background by using `CTRL+I` to **suggest code**.
- [ ] Add a page that displays a list of items, by using `CTRL+I` to **suggest code**.
- [ ] Add a page that allows you to add items to the list, by using `CTRL+I` to **suggest code**.
- [ ] Document a feature using `@workspace`.

## Tips
- Try using `CTRL+I` to **suggest code** for a given part of your code. (Combine it with `CTRL+A` to select all code and query on that.)
- **Add comments** in your code to give Github Copilot **more context** for your task.
- Use the Chat Window to ask about your code using `@workspace` or ask about your IDE using `@vscode`.
- By naming your variables and functions well, you can **guide Github Copilot** to suggest the right code.
- Using `CTRL+I` try doing `/fix` or `/doc` to fix or document your code.

## Disclaimer
- Github Copilot is not perfect. It will make mistakes. It is up to you to decide whether the suggestion is correct or not.
- Github Copilot is not a replacement for your own knowledge or creativity. It is a tool that can help you write code faster.
- Copilot was used to create this README.md.
- When using copilot think about the **legal implications** and **privacy implications** of using it.
